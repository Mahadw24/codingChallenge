So we have solution for all the 3 problems.

For Problem Solving:
we have a folder named 'Problem Solving' and in that folder you find PYTHON files for each question and also a 'problemSolving.txt' in which i discussed and explain every solution. You just need to have python isntalled in laptop and oepn the file in vscode or any editor you use and then in terminal type 'python {filenmae}' and the file will run

For Http server:
I have upload a file named 'serverInNodejs.js' just get this file and make sure you have installed the node in your laptop then open the vs code and then the terminal and go to the path of this file and write 'node serverInNodejs.js' then you will see something like 'Server is running on http://localhost:3000' and then click on this link to open it in browser where you see server is running on port 3000

For LoginComponent in reactjs, typescript and tailwind css:
you will see a folder named 'LoginComponent' just make clone of it locally on your laptop and then make sure you have npm installed and just after clonning type in terminal 'npm i' which installed the node_modules folder and then type 'npm run dev' in terminal to see the login component in website. After typing npm run dev you should check the browser for the link 'https://localhost:5173' and also i have deployed the website on netlify so you can check this link as well 'https://loginreaccttypescripttailwindcss.netlify.app/'

I have also attached the images for reference.
