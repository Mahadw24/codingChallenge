Objective:
Demonstrate your problem-solving and coding skills by writing three distinct functions in any programming language of your choice. Each function should sum up to the number n in a unique way.

Programming Language:
Python. Because it is very easy to readable and good for problem solving questions.

Tasks:

Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using a loop:
def simple_summation(targetNumber):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, targetNumber + 1):
        total += i
    return total

Write a recursive function to perform the same task: summing all integers from 1 to n:
def recursive_summation(targetNumber):
    if targetNumber == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return targetNumber + recursive_summation(targetNumber - 1)

Implement a function that uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of all integers from 1 to n:
def formula_summation(targetNumber):
    return targetNumber * (targetNumber + 1) // 2

Explanation With Analysis:
Simple Summation Function: 
This approach is straightforward and easy to understand. The disadvantage is that it may be slower for large values of n due to the loop.

Recursive Summation Function: 
Recursive solutions are elegant but can lead to stack overflow errors for very large values of n.

Mathematical Formula Implementation:
This is the most efficient method, with a constant time complexity of O(1). It's a great example of optimizing a solution by applying mathematical knowledge.
